Lanthanum-this ones exciting, for I could see this bridging the gap between solids and solid explosives.
 I was thinking that this element would be a solid metal that when exposed to high temperature flame,
  It would release small pieces of bomb and flame, somewhat like thermite and TNT combined.
   It would only explode into such pieces in small sections at a time. Like regular metal except it's
    slightly explosive. This one needs more work.


realistic stars 
- types:
- neutron stars
- white dwaves 
- red dwarf
- yellow sun
- red supergiant 
- blue aelly big ones

star starts at sun mass
u can add HYGN or NBLE to make it grow!
star grows larger and becomes blue
once fusion cycle eats up it becomes either red giant or redsupergiant

red giant becomes white dwarf or maybe supernova
supergiant goes supernova and collapses either into black hole or neutron star

mass can be sucked away by gravity

MOVING SOLIDS 
--------------------------
2.5 torque
3. rotation
torque can be approximated by taking a grid sample of solids across the solid
- grid should start at a particle in the solid to guarente at least 1 sample

Stack editing:
Now you can see, create and modify the stacks, which are a pile of particles in x, y. I named the depth as LVL, which 0 is the normal of TPT, and starts from 1, the gray color is shown when it has a particle in the previous LVL, which is enabled to create a particle, except when the LVL is 1 and 0, which you can create only if you have not.

Here are some keys to modify the LVL:
  F6 -> decrease LVL;
  F7 -> increase LVL;
  F8 -> reset LVL to 0;

Mouse Sensor (MSNS): Senses when the mouse is within range of it & clicks (probably could also serialize position & clicked state)
Frame Sensor (FSNS): Senses whether its been passed a certain amount of frames since its creation (with invert mode to sense when its been less) (serializes the number of frames) (could have modes for fps instead of frames, as well as seconds)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron%E2%80%93hydrogen_resistor
    The idea of a iron-in-hydrogen resistor is, that
    around 700 °C the resistance increases sharply.
    With a little more current, the part of the wire which
    glows dull red grows and the cooler part decreases.
    This results in stabilization of current over a wide
    range of voltage. This resistors could be used for
    DC as well as for AC.
    Bad thing was, that the iron wires in the hydrogen
    were extremly brittle and sensitive to magnetic fields.
    So, they always were used with some magnetic shield.

- 2nd node trimming
    A - B - C -> A - C
    - trim nodes in chips until there's only 1 (trim branches that are chip-chip)
- Add node method
- ReID() nodes method at end that rids of unused nodes

coputeDynamicVoltages polarity check?

floating branch by capacitor makes capcitor not work

retally resistances every second or so?

- better adding method, ie severe lag when molten circuit resolidifies (large circuit)
    - 
- molten circuits tend to resolidify into large messes of nodes
    - entropy grid somehow and limit max number of nodes in a grid if entropy is high
    - count deviations from a straight line
    - alternative: rate limit based on size of circuit - large circuit can only refloodfill every so often

deal with numer of nodes overflowing

limit number of nodes in a circuit anyways? no need to use short, maybe a byte will do
optimize memory:
- undo redo don't save circuit, recompute while paused


updating resistor values should trigger re-solve

check normal SPRK stuff 
- like electrolysis
- control stuff like PSTN, voltage = distnace to push?


possible 2nd node trimming:
- trim nodes that don't conenct to anything 
- nodes in series like A - B - C, trim B to only A-C


use sparsematrix solver somehow?

portals maybe
- portalsa re just buffer chips maybe

no parallel plate capacitance - capacitance would be so low instantly goes to steady state which is empty
no diode like transistors - sepretate element for polarity

PNP:
         C
base (B)-|
         E
if V_BE < 0.7 then do nothing
if V_BE > some max voltage turn into short
else 0.7 V drop

NPN: do opposite

RSPRK removes circuit when deleted - move that to kill_part

- magnetic field induces inductor current

realistic batteries 

op amp maybe

pnp, npn transistors

multi-node group:
- are "dynamic"
- constrain voltages at nodes

photoresistor, potetiometer (user controlled?)

long branches, possibly estimate wire thickness and divide out resistance?
- idk how effective resistance would work then, maybe save effective resistances in array?

- Components communicate with eachother via FILT network inside the ship
which operates using flood fill to transfer data
- Each component is assigned an ID in network
-- HULL, Hull, Hull of the ship
-- COTR, Controller
   - Fires signal once every three frames so components can update and communicate
   - Stores component id's
   - Tells each component when to use the FILT network
   - Components write data after COTR sends data. if no data is received then we can assume componenet has been destroyed
   and remove it from the set of component id's
   - Control signals (FILT has 32 bit CTYPE)

-- NAVI, Navigation
   -- Tells the ship to go somewhere? idk
   -- Different operating modes
   Altitude Control, Stick to coordinate, Maintain distance from enemy
   101: MOVE, <direction:2>00
-- THRS, Thruster, Applies thrust to the ship body
   -- Stores direction thruster has been attached to ship
   -- Calculates by which side of the thruster is more open.
   Draws a fancy cone
   -- Operating capacity depends on how much damage thruster has taken
