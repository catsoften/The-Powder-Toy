# SIGN

The sign tool is the same, but we added some new signs:

```
{mod}    - Name of the mod
{vx}     - VX of particle
{vy}     - VY of particle
{gen}    - Generation of GOL underneath
```

Realistic circuit specific signs: (RSPK only)
```
{volt} or {v}     - Voltage of the pixel below
{current} or {i}  - Current of pixel below
```
