### Bismuth

**Description:**  *Bismuth. Forms square crystals when melted then cooled.*

Breaks into BRMT at > 5 pressure and melts at 544 K. Has low heat conductivity, conducts SPRK. When melted and cooled slowly will grow multicolored square crystals. Sparking BSMH will also cause it to change color (but not grow crystals). Square crystals are at most a 
29x29 square.

BSMH can be used to dope SLCN into NSCN.

## Technical
#### Properties
**ctype:** 1 = pure, non-crystallized, otherwise crystallized

**tmp:** 0 = Crystal state not set, 1 = Inert, > 1 = Max crystal growth size

**tmp2:** Current crystal growth size

**tmp3:** Should it appear "dark" (as a dark band)

**tmp4:** Index in the colors array, used to randomize crystal color.
