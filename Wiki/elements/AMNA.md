# AMNA
### Ammonia

**Description:**  *Ammonia. Created from nitrogen and hydrogen, decomposes in an endothermic reaction.*

Turns liquid und high pressure (> 20) or below -33.34 C, freezes at -77.73 C. Reacts with ACID to form DSTW, reacts with 
water types to form SOAP. Turns PLNT into VINE, and above 500 C or below 15 pressure will randomly decay into H2 and N2 in a 
3:1 ratio. This reaction reduces the temperature by 15 C.
