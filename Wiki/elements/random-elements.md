## SHPO
Shampoo, evaporates into water vapor at 100 C. Cures VIRS. Will clean any deco color, and reset ALL properties (except temp) back 
to the original defaults. If a particle has a Create function, it will be called too. SHPO will make bubbles and slowly dissolve powders. 
Note: washing HAIR with too much SHPO might dissolve it. 

## HAIR
A powder, will instantly freeze when near the head of STKM or STKM2 (and FIGH, but it won't follow sometimes). It will follow the head 
of STKM and STKM2. You can decorate hair into shapes (ie to make arms or clothes). Hair will also freeze when it has
touched GEL or is below 0 C. When touching powders hair can be "dirtied" and take on the color of the powder as a deco color. If 
the STKM head moves too fast the HAIR will break apart.

## MONY (Money)
Like a magnet, attracts STKM and STKM2. Turns OIL, COAL, BCOL and GOLD into MONY on contact. Glows slightly. Deadly to STKM.

JCB1, FIGH, STKM, STKM2, MONY, OIL, DEST, BOMB, SING, TANK, ACID, BCTR, VIRS, SPDR, Any fire type, EMP, WARP, GNSH, FFLD, SHLD, LOVE, NPLM,

Cools any hot particles down to room temperature. May produce SMKE when cleansing.
