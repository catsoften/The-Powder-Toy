**Description:**  *Resistor. Set resistivity / px as tmp3.*

Set the tmp3 for resistance per pixel. Resistors with a tmp3 < 0 will have it set to 1 as default.

Resistors will melt at 1400 C. Resistor also works for SPRK, SPRK will conduct slowly like in SLTW.

## Technical
#### Properties
**tmp3:** Resistance per pixel (in ohms)
