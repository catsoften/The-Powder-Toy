# Minor Elements

## GLUE
Sticks powders together into solids (Not a moving solid, just a solid). Hardens on contact or pressure, and melts under higher temperatures (> 70 C). Above 300 C turns to CMRC. Converts GLOW into LCRY. Extremely flammable.

## TPRS (Temperature Preserver)
Use for heaters or coolers, it will stay at whatever temp you set it to (Use HEAT / COOL or console) but still conduct its temperature. For example, if you set it to 0 K and pour LAVA on it, the LAVA will cool down but it will never heat up.

## NLPM
Napalm, sticky long burning liquid. Burns slowly, but can quickly create fireballs when its spread out in the air.

## FREZ
Cold gas that does not lose heat, but will cool down anything it touches as long as its own temperature is above 20 K. Unlike other coolers,
this also puts out fires and PLSM. Ignites C5. Undergoes cold-fusion at low temperatures and high pressures.

## BGEL (Ballistic Jelly)
Brightens depending on the highest magnitude of the pressure it experienced, useful for bomb testing. Stores the magnitude in tmp3.

## DFLM (Dark Flame)
Like a combination of CAUS and VIRS. Burns slowly through almost anything. Will decay slowly if it hasn't burnt anything in a long time. 
Turns into FIRE if cooled below 10 K. Undergoes "renewals" where its temperature increases 
400 degrees and life gets renewed.

## SFLD (Superfluid)
Evaporates into NEON at 27.102 K, likes to "flow" along solids. Suffers no loss, air drag or diffusion, and has max thermal conductivity.

## CMNT (Cement)
Slowly hardens into either RCRT, CNCT or STNE depending on how impure it is (determined by tmp2). Adding SLTW or SWTR raises 
impurity by 5 for each particle absorbed, being near CRBN, DUST or SALT randomly adds 2 impurity. Above 50 impurity turns into CNCT 
instead of RCRT, above 120 impurity turns into STNE instead of CNCT.

For every 50 C above 0 C RCRT hardens 1 life faster. Adding water increases life by 200 / particle, life is averaged out in a group of cement. Heats up slightly when cooling, turns darker as it hardens. Maxes out life at 3000, sticks like GEL. Turns into STNE at 983 K.

## CMTP (Cement Powder)
Mix with any type of water to make CMNT. Starts with 500 life. If SLTW or SWTR is used starts at 100 impurity. Melts at 983 K.

## CESM (Cesium)
A supped up rubidium, as suggested [https://powdertoy.co.uk/Discussions/Thread/View.html?Thread=21682](here). Explodes like TNT but slightly 
stronger on contact with any varient of water or water vapor. Conducts electricity. Melts at 28 C in LCSM. Changes PHOT into ELEC. Can 
react with O2 to form cesium oxide and Au to form cesium auride. CsAu conducts as fast as gold.

There are also some reactions with ACID / CAUS to form SALT and HYGN or WATR or GOLD depending on the type of CESM. Cesium oxide 
is darker than regualr CESM and cesium auride is more golden.

## LCSM (Liquid cesium)
Same as CESM, but liquid. Explodes at 1600 C. When it goes above 671 C it will 
start to glow and bubble a bit, and won't conduct electricity. Same reactions as CESM.

## AERO (Aerogel)
Perfect heat insulator (But doesn't block SPRK). Destroyed under pressure > 9.0. Does not block most radiation.

## C6
A more powerful version of C4, releases red EMBR, FIRE, and burning BCOL on exploding. Also releases more pressure and heat.

## BRAS (Brass)
Kills BCTR. Melts at 900 C. Accelerates air velocity. Make by melting ZINC and COPR together.

## PAPR (Paper)
Turns into PULP when soaked in excessive water. Soaking in water or water vapor turns it slightly darker, and causes 
dcolor to "diffuse" a bit. Will dry out over time. Drying increases by 1 life value for every 10 degrees above 0 C. 
There is no rate penalty if below 0 C. Becomes stained by liquids and powders.

Paper will lose its dcolor when turning into PULP, so you can use this to "recycle" paper.

## PULP (Paper pulp)
Slowly turns into PAPR. Solidifies faster when hot (Bonus 1 life for each 10 C above 0 C). Max life of 40000. Life increases 
by 100 for each water it touches. At 451 F (232.8 C) PULP ignites. PULP can be created by puting SAWD into SHRD then mixing 
the broken SAWD with water.

## ASPK (Anti-static powder)
Light powder, sticks to conductors within 2px and prevents them from conducting spark. Auto-ignites at 1583 K, otherwise does not burn. Poor heat conductor. Also absorbs electrons, anti-protons. THDR will be absorbed without exploding. Blocks LIGH.

## NTRI (Neutrino)
Glows when inside of another element, turns NEUT -> ELEC + PHOT and ELEC -> PHOT. Goes through everything (even DMND).

Will "copy" temp of particles that are not HEAC, and set HEAC's temp to its own when it passes through it. NTRI will trigger BOMB, 
but not DEST. NTRI causes DEUT to explode with newtonian gravity and pressure.

## MILK
Heals STKM, slowly spoils. Can slow down spoiling by keeping it cold (< 5 C) or pasturizing it (heating it to around 70 C for a while. Putting it near SOIL, MUD, BCOL, COAL or BCTR will increase the rate it spoils. Turns into BCTR when spoiled. Evaporates into calcium and water.

## SUFR (Sulfur)
Burns quickly into a blue flame. Melts at 115.2 C. Turns into CAUS when near fire, turns into ACID when mixed with GLOW and turns 
into GUN when mixed with BCOL. Kills ANT and BCTR. SUFR + NEUT -> PHSP

## H2O2 (Hydrogen Peroxide)
Explosive fuel. Kills BCTR and VIRS (Deletes it completely). Deadly to STKM. Freezes at -0.4 C and boils at 150.2 C. Mix with 
sulfur to make acid. (There's no sulfur dioxide in TPT sorry). Slowly decays into hydrogen and distilled water, this process 
can be sped up by heating it. Slightly corrosive.

## 009 (SCP-009)
Water, but it freezes at 0 C+ and turns into a gas at -100 C-. Solid SCP-009 grows crystals. SCP-009 spreads in most water 
based elements, including PLNT, FLSH, water, MILK, etc...

## ACOL (Anti coal)
Like coal, but burns with CFLM. Shatters under pressure into BACL

## BCAL (Broken anti coal)
Like anti coal, but a powder.

## ALGE (Algae)
Converts SMKE / CO2 into O2, grows on the surface of water.

## INDI (Indestructible Insulator)
Indestructible heat insulator, doesn't actually block sparks like INSL.

## BAKS (Baking soda)
Puts out fires, turns into CO2 on contact with ACID or CAUS, kills BCTR, clears deco color slowly, reacts with vinegar. At above 80 C 
it turns into CO2 and WATR. Reacts with VNGR to make FOAM.

## PINV (Powered invisible)
Allows particles when powered. Unlike regular INVIS, does not allow energy particles when off (not even PROT or NTRI), nor does it modify any energy particles like INVIS does (ie, PROT -> NEUT).

## FLRN (Flourine)
Flourine will burn almost anything, other than CLNE types, VOID types, indestructible materials, noble gases, holy water,
fire types, FREZ and FRZZ. Flourine can be safely stored in a non-flammable container below 200 C. Flourine produces ACID
when mixed with water types.

When burning flourine can dissolve almost anything, even ACID proof materials.
