
## SUGR
Sugar, melts at 186 C, provides food for bacteria. Flammable. Reacts with ACID and CAUS to form CRBN and water vapor, dissolves in water to form SWTR. YEST grows in SUGR. Grows slowly in sugar water. Split by NEUT into carbon, oxygen and hydrogen.

## SWTR (Sugar water)
Water that has sugar dissolved in it. Grows YEST, basically SLTW but with SUGR instead of SALT. Grows PLNT slowly.

## HONY (Honey)
Sticky liquid. Other life forms (except ANT) will not EAT HONY. HONY slowly kills BCTR. Turns solid near WAX or when cold (< 20 C). Heals STKM 5 HP.

## SOIL
A nice element to plant SEED in. Freezes solid when < 0 C, above 60 C turns into CLST. Absorbs water to turn into MUD, if it 
absorbs SLTW or SWTR it might create SUGR or SALT. When it's cold it turns blueish. tmp2 is used for ant hills, if tmp2 = 1 or 2
acts like a tunnel (doesn't move, and if tmp2 = 2, slightly darker and allows particles to pass).

## MUD
A liquid that creates slight negative pressure. Turns into BRCK above 500 C, below 0 C or above 100 C it will act solid.

## WEB
Sticky solid, gets displaced like GOO. Will dissolve if there are no surrounding web particles. Draws "connections" like SOAP bubbles. 
If BIRD, ANT or BEE touches WEB it instantly turns into WEB (ctype BEE, BIRD, etc...) and can be eaten by SPDR. Captured prey will be 
freed if their web dissolves. WEB slows down liquids and powders with weight < 50. Above 500 C it instantly ignites.
