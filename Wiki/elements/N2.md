# N2
## Nitrogen

**Description:**  *Nitrogen gas. Non-flammable. Puts out fires.*

A boring gas that does almost nothing. Photons will reflect off in a blue wavelength. Puts out fires.
N2 + ACID -> AQRG, N2 + NITR -> GEL. Liquifies into liquid nitrogen at -210 C (note: liquid nitrogen does not 
evaporate back into N2)

When touching 3 hydrogen (or realistic hydrogen) and is above 20 pressure and 100 C has a small chance to produce ammonia
(about 1/20000). If it's touching IRON or PTNM, it will have a 1/200 chance (all chances are per frame). This reaction produces 
5 C of heat.
