# ALMN
### Aluminium

**Description:**  *Aluminium. Blocks pressure, shatters when hit with high velocity particles.*

Melts at 993.7 K and shatters into BRKN (ALMN) when hit by a particle traveling at 10 px / frame or greater. Solid ALMN blocks all pressure, even better than TTAN (1 px gaps won't let pressure through!). ALMN cannot be destroyed by acid, and has max heat conduction. 

When ALMN is above 500 C it can ignite when touching FIRE, although it is extremely difficult and will most likely only a few pixels briefly releasing a few px of white FIRE before being put out.

Broken ALMN can be combined with BRMT at high temperatures to make THRM, just like BREL. (Although broken ALMN is faster).

Can be used to dope SLCN into PSCN.

#### Properties
**life:** Used for SPRK

**tmp2:** Burn time left, in frames. Has a chance to disappear when done burning.
